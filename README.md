## Technologies & Tools

**Cloud Platform**: AWS (S3, Glue, Redshift, EventBridge, Step Functions, SNS)
**Orchestration**: AWS Step Functions
**Data Processing**: AWS Glue (PySpark)
**Data Warehouse**: Amazon Redshift
**Storage**: Amazon S3
**Language**: Python, SQL

**Key AWS Services & Concepts**:

  - **AWS EventBridge**: Triggers the state machine upon S3 file creation.
  - **AWS Glue Crawler**: Registers metadata for raw S3 data and Redshift dimensions.
  - **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates the sequential execution of Crawler $\rightarrow$ Glue Job, including conditional polling.
  - **Glue Job Bookmarking**: Enables **incremental processing** by tracking processed S3 data partitions.
  - **`glue:startJobRun.sync`**: Ensures the orchestrator waits for the ETL job to complete before proceeding.
  - **AWS SNS**: Provides immediate success and failure notifications for the entire workflow.

-----

## Overview

This project implements a fully serverless, end-to-end data pipeline for daily flight data ingestion.

1.  **Ingest:** New flight data files (`.csv`) land in the dedicated S3 raw bucket.
2.  **Trigger:** An **AWS EventBridge Rule** detects the S3 `Object Created` event with a `.csv` suffix and invokes the AWS Step Function.
3.  **Orchestrate (Crawler):** The Step Function starts the **Glue Crawler** and polls its status until it completes, ensuring the Glue Catalog is updated with new file metadata.
4.  **Process (ETL):** The Step Function triggers the **AWS Glue PySpark Job**. This job reads the raw incremental data from the catalog and the dimension table (`dim_airport_codes`) from Redshift.
5.  **Transform:** The Glue job performs a **two-pass join** (one for origin, one for destination) to enrich the data, resolving both `OriginAirportID` and `DestAirportID` to full city, state, and airport names.
6.  **Load:** The resulting enriched fact data is written to the target `daily_flights_processed` table in Redshift.
7.  **Alert:** The Step Function publishes a **Success or Failure message** to an SNS Topic, based on the outcome of the Glue Job.

## Trade-offs and Design Rationale

This batch-oriented, event-driven architecture was chosen over alternative solutions based on the following engineering trade-offs:

| Design Choice | Rationale & Benefit | Trade-off (What was sacrificed) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS Glue Job Bookmarking** | Guarantees **incremental processing**, drastically reducing processing time and cost by avoiding reprocessing old data. | Requires the source data to be partitioned correctly (e.g., by date) and is dependent on the stability of the S3 file structure. |
| **EventBridge + Step Functions** | Achieves **zero-ops automation** and centralizes **complex dependency management** (Crawler $\rightarrow$ Glue Job). | Introduces orchestration complexity (writing States Language) and slight latency while the Step Function polls the Glue Crawler. |
| **Glue Crawler Polling** | **Mitigates race conditions** by ensuring the Glue Catalog metadata is current before the ETL job attempts to read new partitions. | Adds a mandatory **wait time** (10 seconds minimum in this design) to the critical path, preventing true sub-second ingestion. |
| **Redshift Target** | Provides a highly performant **SQL data warehouse** for joins and BI reporting, which is superior for complex analytics. | Higher per-GB cost than writing to a simple Parquet lake (S3); requires managing Redshift connections and cluster sizing. |
| **Two-Pass Join** | Ensures full enrichment of both **departure and arrival details** in the final denormalized fact table using standard Glue/Spark joins. | Less efficient than a single complex SQL join in Redshift (ELT); requires intermediate memory/shuffle in Glue. |

-----

## Business Impact & Real-World Applications

The pipeline produces the **`daily_flights_processed`** table in Redshift, enabling valuable analytical queries:

**1. Delay Analysis by Enriched Location:**
*Impact*: Analysts can instantly identify the cities and states responsible for the longest average delays.

```sql
SELECT
  dep_city,
  dep_state,
  AVG(dep_delay) AS avg_departure_delay
FROM
  airlines.daily_flights_processed
GROUP BY
  dep_city,
  dep_state
ORDER BY
  avg_departure_delay DESC;
```

**2. Carrier Performance Comparison:**
*Impact*: Management can compare the performance of different carriers based on average departure and arrival delays in a single query.

## 📑 Data Model & Tables

### Data Model (Amazon Redshift)

**Dimension Table: `airlines.dim_airport_codes`**

  * **Purpose:** Static lookup table used for data enrichment.
  * **Schema (Input):** `airport_id` (BIGINT), `city` (VARCHAR), `state` (VARCHAR), `name` (VARCHAR).

**Fact Table: `airlines.daily_flights_processed`**

  * **Purpose:** Clean, enriched final output, appended to incrementally.
  * **Schema (Output - Denormalized):**
      * `carrier` (VARCHAR), `dep_delay` (BIGINT), `arr_delay` (BIGINT)
      * `dep_airport`, `arr_airport` (VARCHAR) - *Enriched*
      * `dep_city`, `arr_city` (VARCHAR) - *Enriched*
      * `dep_state`, `arr_state` (VARCHAR) - *Enriched*

-----

## Production-Ready Features

  - ✅ **Incremental Processing**: Utilizes **AWS Glue Job Bookmarking** to only process new partitions of data.
  - ✅ **Event-Driven Trigger**: Pipeline is completely automated via **AWS EventBridge** listening for S3 object creation.
  - ✅ **Automated Polling**: **Step Functions** implement polling logic to ensure the Glue Crawler completes before the main ETL job is initiated, preventing metadata failure.
  - ✅ **Synchronous Execution**: Uses `glue:startJobRun.sync` to treat the ETL job as a single, trackable task within the Step Function.
  - ✅ **Error Handling & Alerting**: Includes a **`Catch` block** in the Step Function to handle Glue Task Failures, immediately routing to an **SNS Notification**.

-----

## Execution & Results

The video demonstration confirms the pipeline's operational success:

1.  **Trigger:** A file upload to S3 initiates the workflow.
2.  **Monitor:** The AWS Step Functions graph view shows the State Machine executing all tasks successfully (green).
3.  **Validate:** The final SQL query on the Redshift fact table displays the fully enriched columns, confirming that the two-pass join successfully populated the departure and arrival city/airport names.

-----

## Future Enhancements

  - [ ] **Data Quality Checks**: Implement AWS Deequ within the Glue job to validate data quality (e.g., ensuring `DepDelay` is not null) before writing to Redshift.
  - [ ] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Migrate the Glue Job, Step Function, and EventBridge configurations to **AWS CloudFormation or Terraform** for full declarative deployment.
  - [ ] **Data Lineage**: Integrate a tool like **OpenLineage** with Glue to automatically track data lineage from S3 to Redshift.
  - [ ] **Optimize Redshift**: Implement partitioning on the Redshift fact table by a date/time column for improved query performance.
